# OnlineJavaTest
This is an app where 10 mcq questions are there based on the Java programming. In this, I have used only core Java codes and not added extra dependency or jar files to this project. We are using "swing" package,  "java.awt" library  because of the ActionListener is used to handle all the actions performed in the methods.
